# light-therapy
This project utilizes the Arduino Uno R3 board, the Arduino IDE, the ADX1335 sensor, the NodeMCU ESP8266 and some LED strips. 

This project was created during extended confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
My goal was to create a synthetic light source that would: 
- Replicate the movement of the sun; - Adapt to current weather forecast; 
- Change depending on the user's physical activity completed during the day; 
- Ease the side effects that occur during confinement and Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD).
